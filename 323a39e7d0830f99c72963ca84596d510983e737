      "message": "Now I\u0027m confused if you are suggesting to invoke \"git merge\" 5k times for each commit individually like Lukasz suggested above, or if you mean to merge the two heads and then to resolve a large conflict at once.\n\nIf you mean to merging the two heads with a single merge command, that would then require lots of more difficult work to sort out the reject/conflict than the workflow I used.\n\nThis did 5k cherry picks and at every failed cherry-pick it invoked logics to resolve the rejects with automation (kdiff3 in batch mode) to avoid losing commits where an automated resolution is possible, but that git cannot resolve (and clearly I cannot use ours/theirs, it needs 3way logics to take the decision if a conflict can be resolved automatically). I didn\u0027t spend almost any time resolving any conflict. I only checked those commits that couldn\u0027t be merged automatically appeared not critical and I fixed a few bits for the build (as in the timer driver).",

      "message": "I guess the problem here is gerrit, but it\u0027s not ideal to pick a workflow just because it\u0027s the workflow gerrit can handle natively. If this was gitlab I could have posted the 5k cherry-picks as 5k incremental commits (with no merge commit) here instead of being able to post only the flattened version with a link to the signed tag with the cherry-picks in an external git tree...\n\nOn a side note, I forgot to specify it in the header, I also verified that each commit that got successfully cherry-picked by the automation, didn\u0027t have a fixme commit in the same range that failed its cherry-picking. That\u0027s something to double check every time, to be sure the automation didn\u0027t succeed at merging a bug, but failed to merge the incremental fix.",
